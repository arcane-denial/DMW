    "Let us now look at the problem of how to represent an object. Suppose we want to represent a person, how do we go about this? To answer this, we first need to describe a person i.e., what are the characteristics or features of a person that we can use to define a person? Some of the features that we can use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* age (continuous)\n",
    "* gender (categorical)\n",
    "* height (continuous)\n",
    "* weight (continuous)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed each feature can be considered as a variable in the Statistics sense, so their type, as discussed in ACS, is indicated as well. Even before you started with MSDS, it should be quite intuitive for you to create a spreadsheet with the features above as the columns and each person as a row if you are given a set of people to write down their information for. It might not be obvious to you then but in fact, a spreadsheet of features as columns and objects as rows _is_ a matrix and each row _is_ a vector. The matrix and row that we are referring to are the same _matrix_ and _row_ that were discussed in MDS.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering: but what about gender--it's not a number! Indeed you are correct. To complete our _vector space representation_ of people, we have to convert age, which is a categorical variable, into numbers. The usual approach is to perform one-hot encoding. This is the same as creating dummy or indicator variables in Statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To one-hot encode a categorical variable with $N$ unique values, we replace the variable with $N$ features with each feature corresponding to a unique value of the variable. The new features are indicator variables: we assign a value of 1 to the corresponding indicator variable and we set a value of 0 to the other new features. If the number of unique values is quite small, the new features won't be totally independent. To avoid this, we can omit creating a new feature for one of the feature values, effectively assigning the all-zero value to the omitted feature value. If a categorical value has only two unique values then we can replace it with just one indicator variable, effectively converting the original categorical feature into a boolean.\n",
